# matplotlib-challenge

I received some help on this matplotlib challenge from the following:

I received help from my tutor with understanding the difference between generating a plot using pandas vs. matplotlib. I also learned how to use "rotation" to change the angle of the axis labels. We also discussed the process for how to get the final tumor volume for only four of the treatment regimens by using a for loop, filtering by drug and top time points then merging this dataframe with the origianl dataframe using a left join (so it drops all the other values not needed).

From AskBCS Learning Assistants, I received help using the nunique() code correctly to figure out the total number of mice in the clean data set. 

I used the following websites:
https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/pyplot_summary.html - Generate the pie plot using pyplot
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html- To merge each of the four drugs dataframes into one dataframe.
